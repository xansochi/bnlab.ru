Russian adaptation of Braverman Nature Assessment (BNA).
This is a personality test that categorizes your brain function through a series of behavioral questions, which provides deeper knowledge and shows results of not only your strengths but also your weaknesses.

A small personal project for my portfolio and for my own pleasure.

The application happily lives in the public domain and pleases curious users.
